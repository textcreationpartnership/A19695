            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9623:4"/> from another, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of ſententious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſpeeches, that have a generall lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of themſelves, as ſo many flowers in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or Iewels in a caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, whereof every one hath a diſtinct worth of themſelves; and this maketh them the more acceptable that being ſhort, they are fitter for the heart to carry, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving much in a little.</p>
            <p>This moved, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend man of God, to ſpend what ſpare houres his ſickneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:9623:4"/> would afford him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoughts in this kinde. He was many yeeres Gods priſoner under the Gout and Stone, ſuch diſeaſes, as will allow but little liberty to thoſe that are arreſted and tortured by them. So fruitfull an expence of time, in ſo weake and worne a body is ſeldome ſeene, ſcarce any came to him but went away better than they came; God gave much ſtrength of ſpirit to uphold his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from ſinking under
<pb facs="tcp:9623:5"/> the ſtrength of ſuch diſeaſes. It were a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py thing if we that are Miniſters of Chriſt, would in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and times thinke of our calling, that our office is not tyed to one day in a week, and one houre or two in that day, but that upon all fit occaſions we are to quicken our ſelves and others in the way homeward, as guides to heaven. We read not of the opening of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but to ſome great purpoſe. So it ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:9623:5"/> bee with the man of God, he ſhould not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth and let any thing fall (ſo far as frailty and the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occurrences of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life will permit) but what might mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſome grace to the hearers.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why I made choiſe of you to dedicate them unto, is not that I might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge mine own debt unto you with another mans coyne, but that I could not thinke of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fitter than your ſelf,

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:9623:104"/> to encreaſe their faith by repentance, whereas there is no ſound repentance which comes not from faith, and therefore rather<note place="margin">No ſound repentance which comes not from faith.</note> we muſt by our faith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our repentance, which as the fruit ſhall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the tree good.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:9623:104"/> obedience. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, the chiefe cauſe I ſpeake of, of our little growth in Chriſtianitie is this, that of all matters in the Scriptures, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes<note place="margin">Of all matters in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Gods promiſes are now leaſt regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> are leaſt remembred and regarded in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meditations or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, yea I may ſay in our publique miniſterie; whereas theſe above all other as the nurſes of our faith, and ſo of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, are daily to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated on and dealt with: and for this cauſe I doe commend it to every true Chriſtian as a ſingular meanes of bettering his whole courſe, that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by all meanes to have in memory ſtore of Gods promiſes generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
